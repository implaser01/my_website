The company wants to determine the optimum product mix of interior and exterior paints that maximizes the total daily profit.

```{r}

#Creating the function
product_mix <- function(paint){
  Ext <- paint[1]
  Int <- paint[2]
  Profit <- 50000*min(5,Ext) + 70000*max(Ext-5,0) + Int*40000
  if(Int > 5 |#interior paint max is 5
     Int < 0 |#interior paint cant be lower than 0
     Ext < 0 |#exterior paint cant be lower than 0
     Ext*6 + Int*4 >24 |#maximum availability of raw material M1 is 24, ext includes 6 M1 and Interior includes 4 M1
     Ext*1 + Int*2 > 6)#maximum availability of raw material M2 is 6, ext includes 1 M1 and Interior includes 2 M1
    {
    return(-Inf) #retunring -inf for values outside bounds
  }else{
    return(Profit)
  }
}

#creating a potential feasible mix
feasible <- c(4,0)

opt <- optim(par=feasible,fn=product_mix,control = list(fnscale=-1)) #optimization
opt$par
opt$value


# optimizing using SANN method
optalt1 <- optim(par=feasible,fn=product_mix,control = list(fnscale=-1), method = "SANN")
optalt1$par
optalt1$value

```

A product mix of approximately 3 Exterior Paints and 1.5 Interior paints leads to the highest profit of approximately 210,000
