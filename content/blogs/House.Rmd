#downloading data provided by Professor Maryam Khatami 
home_data <- read_csv(here::here("data","West_Roxbury_Modified-1.csv"))
#Making fllor into factors
home_data$FLOORS <- as.factor(home_data$FLOORS)

#Finding age of house
home_data$AGE <- c()
home_data$AGE <- 2020 - home_data$YR.BUILT

#Creating train and validation dataset
train_size <- .7*nrow(home_data)

set.seed(500)

train_index <- sample(x = 1:nrow(home_data), size = train_size, replace = F)

train_set <- home_data[train_index, ]
valid_set <- home_data[-train_index, ]

train_set
valid_set

#Creating model

home_model <- lm(TOTAL.VALUE ~ GROSS.AREA + AGE + FLOORS, train_set) 
summary(home_model)
```

# Interpretation
With an increase of 1 unit of Gross Area, the Total Value of the house increases by 0.08285
With an increase of I year of Age of the house, the total value of the house decreases by 0.44173
If the house has 1.5 floors, its total value is 5.32 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
If the house has 2 floors, its total value is 60.79467 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
If the house has 2.5 floors, its total value is 87.74012 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
Gross Area, Age, 2 floors and 2.5 floors are significant as they have a p value lower than 0.05%
```{r}
#Checking the validity of the model and accuracy

pred_value <- predict(object = home_model, newdata = valid_set)
pred_value_train <- predict(object = home_model, newdata = train_set)

accuracy(pred_value, valid_set$TOTAL.VALUE)
accuracy(pred_value_train, train_set$TOTAL.VALUE)
```


Since there is barely any difference between the RMSE of the model with the 
training and the validation data set, we can conclude that the linear regression
model is not over fitting.

# Performing Logistic Regression
```{r}
home_data2 <- home_data
median_value <- median(home_data2$TOTAL.VALUE)
home_data2$EXPENSIVE <- ifelse(home_data2$TOTAL.VALUE > median_value,1,0)

##question 2
boxplot(home_data2$LIVING.AREA ~ home_data2$EXPENSIVE)
boxplot(home_data2$AGE ~ home_data2$EXPENSIVE)
```
We should use living Area as a predictor of Expensive.As shown in the box plot
houses that  are expensive tend to have a larger living area.
We should not use Age as a predictor of Expensive. As shown in the box plot
houses that that are expensive are only slightly higher in Age with severe 
outliers on both sides if they are expensive.

```{r}
table(home_data2$EXPENSIVE, home_data2$FLOORS)
table(home_data2$EXPENSIVE, home_data2$REMODEL)
```
We should use floors as a predictor for expensive. This is because, as the floors 
increase, a higher percentage of houses in that category are expensive.
In houses with 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 floors, the chance of them being expensive were
16.94%, 28.07%, 68.09%, and 97.14% respectively.
We should use remodel as a predictor for expensive. This is because if the house
has been remodeled recently or in the past, it tends to have a higher likelihood
of being expensive. Houses that never had a remodel, had an old remodel, and have
recently had a remodel have 44.34%. 56.03%, and 74.2% chance of being expensive 
respectively.

```{r}
#validating the model
train_set2 <- home_data2[train_index, ]
valid_set2 <- home_data2[-train_index, ]

model1 <- glm(formula = EXPENSIVE ~ LIVING.AREA + FLOORS + REMODEL, 
               data = train_set2, family = "binomial")
pred_exp_prob <- predict(object = model1, newdata = valid_set2, 
                          type = "response")
cutoff <- 0.5
pred_exp <- ifelse(pred_exp_prob>cutoff,1,0)
sum(pred_exp)


##question 5
summary(model1)

```
