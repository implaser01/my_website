```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code

# default figure size

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}

In this code, I will be simulating the cost of health care plans for an employer for the next 10 months based on historical data

```{r}
### Problem 1
##question 1

home_data <- read_csv(here::here("data","West_Roxbury_Modified-1.csv"))
home_data$FLOORS <- as.factor(home_data$FLOORS)

##question 2
home_data$AGE <- c()
home_data$AGE <- 2020 - home_data$YR.BUILT

##question 3
train_size <- .7*nrow(home_data)

set.seed(500)

train_index <- sample(x = 1:nrow(home_data), size = train_size, replace = F)

train_set <- home_data[train_index, ]
valid_set <- home_data[-train_index, ]

train_set
valid_set

##question 4

home_model <- lm(TOTAL.VALUE ~ GROSS.AREA + AGE + FLOORS, train_set) 
summary(home_model)
##question 5
#With an increase of 1 unit of Gross Area, the Total Value of the house increases by 0.08285
#With an increase of I year of Age of the house, the total value of the house decreases by 0.44173
#If the house has 1.5 floors, its total value is 5.32 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
#If the house has 2 floors, its total value is 60.79467 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
#If the house has 2.5 floors, its total value is 87.74012 higher than a house with 1 floor if everything else remains the same
#Gross Area, Age, 2 floors and 2.5 floors are significant as they have a p value lower than 0.05%

##question 6

pred_value <- predict(object = home_model, newdata = valid_set)
pred_value_train <- predict(object = home_model, newdata = train_set)

accuracy(pred_value, valid_set$TOTAL.VALUE)
accuracy(pred_value_train, train_set$TOTAL.VALUE)

##question 7
#Since there is barely any difference between the RMSE of the model with the 
#training and the validation data set, we can conclude that the linear regression
#model is not over fitting.

###Problem 2
##question 1

home_data2 <- home_data
median_value <- median(home_data2$TOTAL.VALUE)
home_data2$EXPENSIVE <- ifelse(home_data2$TOTAL.VALUE > median_value,1,0)

##question 2
boxplot(home_data2$LIVING.AREA ~ home_data2$EXPENSIVE)
boxplot(home_data2$AGE ~ home_data2$EXPENSIVE)
#We should use living Area as a predictor of Expensive.As shown in the box plot
#houses that  are expensive tend to have a larger living area.
#We should not use Age as a predictor of Expensive. As shown in the box plot
#houses that that are expensive are only slightly higher in Age with severe 
#outliers on both sides if they are expensive.

##question 3
table(home_data2$EXPENSIVE, home_data2$FLOORS)
table(home_data2$EXPENSIVE, home_data2$REMODEL)
#We should use floors as a predictor for expensive. This is because, as the floors 
#increase, a higher percentage of houses in that category are expensive.
#In houses with 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 floors, the chance of them being expensive were
#16.94%, 28.07%, 68.09%, and 97.14% respectively.
#We should use remodel as a predictor for expensive. This is because if the house
#has been remodeled recently or in the past, it tends to have a higher likelihood
#of being expensive. Houses that never had a remodel, had an old remodel, and have
#recently had a remodel have 44.34%. 56.03%, and 74.2% chance of being expensive 
#respectively.

##question 4

train_set2 <- home_data2[train_index, ]
valid_set2 <- home_data2[-train_index, ]

model1 <- glm(formula = EXPENSIVE ~ LIVING.AREA + FLOORS + REMODEL, 
               data = train_set2, family = "binomial")
pred_exp_prob <- predict(object = model1, newdata = valid_set2, 
                          type = "response")
cutoff <- 0.5
pred_exp <- ifelse(pred_exp_prob>cutoff,1,0)
sum(pred_exp)


##question 5
summary(model1)

```

The 95% confidence interval with the monthly premium of $150 is lower than the 95% confidence interval with the monthly premium of $147. This is because the increased monthly premium decreases the total cost expense thereby shifting the confidence interval downwards.
